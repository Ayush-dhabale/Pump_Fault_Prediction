    "### ✅ Actionable Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. 🎯 Focus on High-Impact Sensors\n",
    "- Prioritize monitoring `sensor_00`, `sensor_01`, `sensor_04`, `sensor_17`, and `sensor_23`.\n",
    "- Consider excluding `sensor_15` and sensors above `sensor_40` due to poor data quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. 🛠️ Feature Engineering Enhancements\n",
    "- Utilize PCA-transformed features for future models to enhance speed and reduce overfitting.\n",
    "- Integrate rolling metrics and lag features for better temporal pattern detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. 🚀 Model Deployment & Scalability\n",
    "- Continue using XGBoost in production environments.\n",
    "- Integrate the app with existing dashboards to automate alerts and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. 🧹 Real-time Data Quality Handling\n",
    "- Apply median-based imputation for missing values during data ingestion.\n",
    "- Set automatic alerts for sensors with >5% missing or flatline values.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. 🔭 Explore Advanced Modeling\n",
    "- Implement unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, autoencoders) for novel fault discovery.\n",
    "- Prepare for multi-class classification as more fault categories become labeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. 🧑‍🏭 Operational Integration\n",
    "- Train staff to interpret model output and interact with the deployed application.\n",
    "- Set up a feedback loop to capture incorrect predictions and update the model iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Strategic Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "These data-driven strategies pave the way for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ✅ Reduced unplanned downtime\n",
    "- ✅ Improved fault diagnosis accuracy\n",
    "- ✅ Enhanced predictive maintenance workflows\n",
    "- ✅ Scalable deployment in industrial environments\n",
    "\n",
    "By transforming raw sensor data into actionable intelligence, this solution strengthens reliability and decision-making across operations.\n",
