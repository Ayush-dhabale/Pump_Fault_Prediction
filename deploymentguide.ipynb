    "# **Model Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Deployed Web Application\n",
    "The trained machine learning model for sensor fault detection has been deployed successfully as a web-based application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Access the deployed application here:**  \n",
    "🔗 [https://pumpfaultprediction.streamlit.app/](https://pumpfaultprediction.streamlit.app/)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 Deployment Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The application is built using **Streamlit**, a Python framework ideal for deploying interactive machine learning tools. It allows users to upload sensor data and receive fault predictions in real time. The backend model includes a data preprocessing pipeline with scaling and PCA transformation, followed by a trained classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧭 How to Use the Application\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prepare Your Data**  \n",
    "   - Create a `.csv` file containing **50 columns** labeled `sensor_00`, `sensor_01`, ..., up to `sensor_49`.  \n",
    "   - Each row should represent one observation or reading from the sensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Visit the Application**  \n",
    "   Open the app in any modern web browser:  \n",
    "   [https://pumpfaultprediction.streamlit.app/](https://pumpfaultprediction.streamlit.app/)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Upload the CSV File**  \n",
    "   - Use the sidebar panel to upload your CSV file.  \n",
    "   - Ensure that your file has exactly 50 columns; otherwise, it will return an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Run the Prediction**  \n",
    "   - After uploading, click the **\"🛰️ Predict Faults\"** button.  \n",
    "   - The app will preprocess the data (scaling and dimensionality reduction) and generate predictions using the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **View and Download Results**  \n",
    "   - A preview of the prediction results will be shown on-screen.  \n",
    "   - You can then download the full results as a CSV file containing the original data along with a new `Fault Prediction` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Key Features\n",
